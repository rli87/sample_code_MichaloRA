# Project sample code instructions
**This repository is created for research and coding ability demonstration to researchers. I ask that no one distrubutes my code or data. If you are interested in actual research direction in macro-development or cultural economics, or have any questions on the methodologies, please contact me directly at ruixuan_li@brown.edu**

### Notes:
1. The code is just snippets of the project. For data and code non-disclosure policies, I cannot upload the full code, so you might run into "non-replication" issues.
2. `"scrape.ipydb"` is the code file that scrapes all lyrics according to the Spotify APIs of a machine-learning updated world music chart
3. `lyric_sentiment.ipynb` is the code file that conducts text analysis on the lyrics of another set of Billboard data, converting text to numerical sentiment values using different algorithms, further visualizing with collages/WordClouds.
