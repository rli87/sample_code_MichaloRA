# Project sample code instructions
**This repository is created for research and coding ability demonstration to researchers. I ask that no one distrubutes my code or data. If you are interested in actual research direction in macro-development or cultural economics, or have any questions on the methodologies, please contact me directly at ruixuan_li@brown.edu**
